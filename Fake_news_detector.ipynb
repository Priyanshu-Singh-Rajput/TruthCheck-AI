            "Justification: While numerous studies have explored the correlation between coffee consumption and reduced Alzheimer's risk,  a specific Stanford University study claiming a 60% reduction with at least one cup daily is not readily verifiable through a quick search of reputable scientific journals or news sources focused on Alzheimer's research.  While some studies suggest a potential link between moderate coffee consumption and a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's,  the magnitude of the effect (60% reduction) cited in the claim is exceptionally high and requires corroboration from a published, peer-reviewed study.  The absence of such a readily available study from Stanford University or a prominent scientific journal leads to a verdict of \"Not Enough Evidence.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "Justification: While research suggests a correlation between moderate coffee consumption and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,  finding a definitive statement from a \"Dr. Hannah Yuen\" claiming a \"neuroprotective effect\" of caffeine preventing amyloid plaque buildup requires specific sourcing.  The keywords provided do not yield a readily accessible, verifiable source confirming this exact claim.  Many studies explore the link between caffeine and Alzheimer's, often noting potential benefits, but directly attributing a specific statement to a named researcher necessitates further information like the study's title, publication date, and journal to confirm the claim's accuracy.\n",

            "\n",
            "Justification: While a single quote lacks the full context of a study, numerous studies published in peer-reviewed journals, including those focusing on neuroscience and behavior, have shown a correlation between moderate coffee consumption and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.  These studies often point to coffee's potential impact on amyloid-beta plaque buildup in the brain, a key factor linked to Alzheimer's.  It's important to note that correlation doesn't equal causation, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanism. However, the existing body of research generally lends support to the claim that moderate coffee consumption *may* be a preventive measure, aligning with the quoted statement.\n",

            "\n",
            "Justification:  The provided keywords and claim lack sufficient information to verify the assertion. While the keywords suggest a study relating coffee consumption, amyloid plaques, and Alzheimer's disease,  they don't specify a particular study or provide a source to corroborate the claim about benefits being most notable in individuals aged 50 and above with no previous neurological disorders.  To verify the claim, the specific journal article (\"journal neuroscience behavior\") and study details would need to be identified and reviewed.  Without this information, it's impossible to determine if the researchers made this specific statement regarding age and prior neurological history.\n",

            "\n",
            "Justification: The claim that a study notes a correlational, not causal, relationship is plausible given the context keywords.  Studies on Alzheimer's disease frequently find correlations between factors like amyloid plaque buildup, age, and genetic predisposition, but establishing direct causation is extremely challenging.  The keywords suggest a study investigating a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimer's, a topic where correlational findings are common due to the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors impacting disease development.  While a specific study isn't cited, the nature of Alzheimer's research supports the likelihood of a study acknowledging the limitations of correlational data and the difficulty in proving causality.\n",

            "Justification: While there is research suggesting a potential correlation between moderate coffee consumption and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, due to coffee's potential impact on amyloid plaque buildup, the claim that news of this has \"gone viral across social media platforms, with many users praising the benefits\" is not supported by readily available evidence.  A search for recent news articles or social media trends related to this topic doesn't reveal widespread viral dissemination of this specific finding.  While studies exist linking coffee consumption to potential neuroprotective effects,  the claim lacks evidence of the widespread social media praise it asserts.\n",

            "Justification: While many studies suggest a correlation between moderate coffee consumption and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,  it's true that concerns remain regarding confounding factors.  The claim that health experts highlight the lack of complete control over lifestyle factors (beyond coffee consumption) and genetic predispositions in such studies is accurate.  Alzheimer's disease is complex, with multiple contributing factors, and isolating the impact of coffee alone is challenging.  Therefore,  while associations are observed,  causation isn't definitively established, and the need for further research accounting for other variables is widely acknowledged within the scientific community.\n",
